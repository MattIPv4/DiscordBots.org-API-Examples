# DiscordBots.org Bot Stats API Examples

All files are organised as so: `/{language}/{library}/Example-{type}.{ext}` or in the event no Discord API library is used: `/{language}/Example-{type}.{ext}`.

In every example `DBLAPIKEY` is used to represent where your DiscordBots.org bot api key needs to added (replace the placeholder with your key).

If a Discord API library is not used `DISCORDBOTID` is used to indicate your bot ID and the file will be clearly commented to indicate where a guild count should go.

Types:
* NoShards - Example written to only post guild count without shards.
* Shards - Supports bots that are using shards.
* All - Supports both sharded and non-sharded bots.
