# DiscordBots.org Bot Stats API Examples

All files are organised as so: `/{language}/{library}/Example-{type}.{ext}` or in the event no Discord API library is used: `/{language}/Example-{type}.{ext}`.

In every example `DBLAPIKEY` is used to represent where your DiscordBots.org bot api key needs to added (replace the placeholder with your key).

If a Discord API library is not used `DISCORDBOTID` is used to indicate your bot ID and the file will be clearly commented to indicate where a guild count should go.

## Contributing
### General PR Guidelines
* The code submitted should run correctly and follow the best programming standards for that language
* Use `DBLAPIKEY` to represent the DiscordBots.org bot api key.
* If not using a Discord API library: Use `DISCORDBOTID` for the bot ID and ensure guild count is clearly marked.
* If using a Discord API library: No other information should need to be inserted by the bot owner, use your library to get bot id etc.

### Adding new examples
If you wish to help, please follow the following when creating a PR:
* Example file added in the correct folder location (see above)
* Any examples from the langauge/library removed from to-be-processed-{language}.txt
